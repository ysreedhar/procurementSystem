The cab file for your application has been built as 'C:\Documents and Settings\S M Assad\Desktop\proc\Install-PMS\PMS.CAB'.

There is also a batch file in the support directory (C:\Documents and Settings\S M Assad\Desktop\proc\Install-PMS\Support\PMS.BAT) that will allow you to recreate the cab file in case you make changes to some of the files.
